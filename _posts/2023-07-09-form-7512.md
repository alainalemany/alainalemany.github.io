Form 7512, **Transportation Entry and Manifest of Goods Subject to CBP Inspection and Permit**, is used when the shipment is placed under a CBP bond while traveling from the port of arrival to the intended port of export. As a result, the goods never enter the consumption channels of the United States and an AES filing is not required.
