The primary use of a **Bonded CFS** at the port of origin is to consolidate and load shipments into a container in instances of **Less than Container Load (LCL)** shipments. The **ACE eManifest Ocean** will be required of ocean carriers or their authorized agents before goods are loaded onto the vessel at the port of origin. The reporting time frame is 24 hours before loading at the foreign port of origin.

The ACE eManifest will provide a comprehensive view of all ocean shipments, manifest data, container level or bill of lading data of consolidated or de-consolidated goods.

Once the LCL sea cargo arrives at the destination, it will be sent to a CFS warehouse, where the goods will be segregated and unloaded.
